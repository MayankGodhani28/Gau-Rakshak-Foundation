            How It All Started
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In the summer of 2018, our founder Sarah Johnson witnessed five cows
            abandoned on a property near her home. Malnourished and neglected,
            these gentle giants needed immediate help. What began as an
            emergency rescue mission soon revealed a much larger problem in our
            community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Sarah, along with local veterinarian Dr. Michael Chen and farmer
            Lisa Rodriguez, realized that there was no dedicated sanctuary for
            cows in our region. Together, they decided to change that, pooling
            their resources and expertise to create Gentle Hearts Cow Rescue.

            From those first five cows, our sanctuary has grown to house over 80
            permanent residents and has facilitated the rescue and
            rehabilitation of more than 200 cows over six years. Each cow that
            comes to us has a unique story, but they all share the need for
            compassion and care.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Today, we operate a state-of-the-art facility with 40 acres of
            pasture, veterinary facilities, and educational centers. Our work
            extends beyond rescue to include community education, advocacy for
            animal welfare, and building a network of support for sanctuaries
            nationwide.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            None of this would be possible without our incredible community of
            supporters, volunteers, and dedicated staff who share our vision of
            a world where every cow can live with dignity and love.
